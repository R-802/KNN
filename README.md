# k-Nearest Neighbor

The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a straightforward classification or regression technique used in supervised learning. It operates on the principle that similar data points tend to share similar labels. Given a new data point, KNN identifies the \(k\) closest training data points (neighbors) and assigns the majority class label (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of these neighbors to the new point.

**Key points about k-Nearest Neighbor classification:**
- **Hyperparameter \(k\):** The algorithm's behavior hinges on the choice of the hyperparameter \(k\), which specifies the number of neighbors to consider when making predictions.
- **Distance metric:** KNN employs a distance metric, often the Euclidean distance, to quantify the similarity between data points. The Euclidean distance between two points $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ is given by:
  
$$\ \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \$$ 
  
 <p align="center"> In an $n$-dimensional space, the formula generalizes to: </center>
  
$$\ \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{2} - x_{1})^2} \$$
  
 <p align="center"> Where $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the i-th components of the two points. </center>

- **Decision boundary:** KNN doesn't formulate a model; rather, it remembers the training data. Consequently, its decision boundary can be intricate and nonlinear, mirroring the distribution of the training data.
- **Scalability:** KNN's effectiveness may dwindle with large datasets, as it necessitates computing distances for each prediction.

**Implementation**
The provided Python implementation showcases the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a focus on handling 3-dimensional data and visualizing the results using the matplotlib library.

Data Generation: Random 3D data points are generated to simulate a dataset with three features. The binary labels (0 or 1) are assigned to the data points.

KNN Class: A KNN class is defined to encapsulate the KNN algorithm. It includes methods for fitting the model to the training data and making predictions for new data points.

Fitting: The fit method of the KNN class stores the training data and labels.

Prediction: The predict method of the KNN class calculates predictions for new data points using the _predict method. The _predict method calculates distances to training data points, selects the 
k nearest neighbors, and predicts the class based on majority vote.

Grid Generation: Grid points are generated to visualize the decision boundary in 3D space. This is achieved by creating ranges for each feature and using np.meshgrid to create the grid.

Visualization: Matplotlib's Axes3D module is used to create a 3D scatter plot of the training data points. The points are colored based on their assigned binary labels. The decision boundary is also visualized using a contour plot, which is generated by predicting the class for each point in the grid.

Optimizations and Considerations:

Vectorized Calculations: The distance calculations are vectorized using numpy operations to improve efficiency.

Grid Step Size: The step size for generating grid points is increased to speed up visualization, although this may result in a less detailed contour plot.

Dataset Size: A dataset of 500 data points is used to balance between realism and performance.

Scalability: For larger datasets or more complex scenarios, optimized libraries like scikit-learn should be considered.
