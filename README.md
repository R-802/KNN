**KNN**

The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a straightforward classification or regression technique used in supervised learning. It operates on the principle that similar data points tend to share similar labels. Given a new data point, KNN identifies the \(k\) closest training data points (neighbors) and assigns the majority class label (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of these neighbors to the new point.

**Key points about k-Nearest Neighbor classification:**
- **Hyperparameter \(k\):** The algorithm's behavior hinges on the choice of the hyperparameter \(k\), which specifies the number of neighbors to consider when making predictions.
  /
- **Distance metric:** KNN employs a distance metric, often the Euclidean distance, to quantify the similarity between data points. The Euclidean distance between two points $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ is given by:
  
 $$\ \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \$$
  
In an $n$-dimensional space, the formula generalizes to:
  
$$\ \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{2} - x_{1})^2} \$$
  
 Where $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the i-th components of the two points.

- **Decision boundary:** KNN doesn't formulate a model; rather, it remembers the training data. Consequently, its decision boundary can be intricate and nonlinear, mirroring the distribution of the training data.
  /
- **Scalability:** KNN's effectiveness may dwindle with large datasets, as it necessitates computing distances for each prediction.

**Summary of KNN Implementation with Visualization:**

The provided Python implementation showcases the KNN algorithm and presents its outcomes visually using the matplotlib library. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Data Generation:** Random data points with two features $x$ and binary labels $y$ are generated for explanatory purposes.

2. **KNN Class:** A `KNN` class is defined with `fit` and `predict` methods. The `fit` method stores the training data, and the `predict` method employs the KNN classifier to make predictions on new data.

3. **Prediction:** Predictions are made for each point in a grid of points using the KNN algorithm. This leads to the formation of a decision boundary that demarcates various classes.

4. **Visualization:** The matplotlib library is employed to produce a contour plot of the decision boundary and a scatter plot of the training data points. The contour plot visually captures how the algorithm classifies distinct regions within the feature space.
